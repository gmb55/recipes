INGREDIENTS

2 teaspoons sea salt flakes or 1 teaspoon pouring salt
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
2 cloves garlic
2 pork knuckles / hocks, their rind scored
2 onions
2 eating apples (cored and quartered)
4 baking potatoes or just under 1kg / 2lb other main crop potatoes (cut into quarters lengthwise)
1 x 500 millilitres bottle good amber or dark beer (not stout)
500 millilitres boiling water

METHOD

Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C Fan/gas mark 7 /425°F. Put the salt and caraway seeds into a bowl, mince or grate in the garlic, mix everything together and rub the pork hocks with this mixture, getting well into the slits in the scored rind.
Peel the onions, slice into rounds and make a bed or platform of them in a roasting tin. Sit the hocks on this onion layer and cook them in the hot oven for ½ hour.
Take the tin out of the oven and quickly arrange the apples and potatoes around the hocks, then carefully pour half the beer (250ml / 1 cup) over, aiming for the hocks so they are basted as the liquid pours into the tin. Put back in the oven, turning this down to 170°C/150°C Fan/gas mark 3/325°F and leave to cook at this lower temperature for 2 hours.
Turn the oven up again to 220°C/200°C Fan/gas mark 7/425°F, baste the hocks with the rest of the beer, and leave to cook at the higher temperature for another 30 minutes.
Take the tin out of the oven and transfer the apples and potatoes to a warmed dish. Lift the hocks onto a carving board, leaving the onion and juices in the tin.
Now put the tin on the hob over a medium heat and add 500ml / 2 cups boiling water, stirring to de-glaze the pan to make a gravy.
Take the crackling off the pork and break into pieces, pull apart or carve the meat and serve with the apples, potatoes, gravy and some German mustard.
